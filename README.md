# characterset
Task 2
Character limit Text Area.

I created a simple and interactive character counter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project includes a styled textarea input for user messages and dynamically tracks the number of characters entered, with a maximum limit of 200 characters. As the user types, the counter updates in real-time and shows a warning message when the limit is reached.

âœ¨ Features:

.Real-time character counting

.Maximum 200 character limit

.Warning message when limit is reached

.Clean and responsive design

 This is a great beginner-friendly mini project to practice DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
